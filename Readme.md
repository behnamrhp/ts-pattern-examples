# TS Design Pattern Examples

In this project, you can find descriptions and real-world examples of various design patterns to explore.

## Folder Strcutures

In general, we have three types of design patterns, and based on them, we'll have three folders for each type.

1. [Behavioral](./behavioral/): These patterns focus on the connection between objects.

2. [Structural](./structural/): These patterns provide logic to connect and assemble objects to create larger structures.

3. [Creational](./creational/): These patterns provide ways to create objects to improve flexibility and reusability of your code.
