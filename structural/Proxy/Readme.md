# Proxy Pattern

this pattern provides a placeholder object for other object to contol it. 
proxy object should obey same interface as real object's interface.

# Example 
in this example we want to have a proxy class for caching requests of articles.
so we can have an ArticleProxy class to control caching of article requests.
