# üè≠ Differences Between Abstract Factory and Factory Method üè≠

At first glance, these patterns may seem similar, but the main distinction lies in the scale at which they solve the same problem. 

## Factory Method Pattern Example:
Consider a scenario where a pizza store offers NY style and Chicago style pizzas, each with its distinct flavor profile and toppings but for one main product. Despite these differences, the payment process for both types of pizzas remains consistent.

## Abstract Factory Pattern Example:
Continuing with our pizza theme, let's say we have a factory of pizza ingredients and we want to create NY and Chicago style pizzas ingredients, each with its unique dough, sauce, and cheese and sell them as packages to related stores. The abstract factory pattern allows us to define interfaces for pizza ingredients (e.g., Dough, Sauce, Cheese) and provide concrete implementations (e.g., NYPizzaIngredientFactory, ChicagoPizzaIngredientFactory) for each pizza families.

## Differences:

### Purpose and Scale:
Factory Method Pattern: It's geared towards creating variations of a single type of product (e.g., pizzas) with subclasses handling the creation of specific products (e.g., NY style pizza, Chicago style pizza).
Abstract Factory Pattern: It's designed for creating families of related products (e.g., pizza ingredients) without specifying concrete classes, providing a higher level of abstraction to manage multiple products families.

### Structure and Flexibility:
Factory Method Pattern: It typically involves a creator class with a method for creating products, allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects created. also creator class can handle same business logics related to this product.
Abstract Factory Pattern: It involves interfaces for abstract products and concrete implementations for each family of products.

## Conclusion
In essence, Both patterns are about creating objects. But you can use the factory method pattern when usually need to focus on variations of a single type of product and you can use the abstract factory pattern when you need more abstract level of problem about handling families of related products.
